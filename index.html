                                        We love catering to every kind of beer drinker at Sullivan's Liquors. We always stock plenty of domestic and imported brand name beers and ales. We sell singles, 6 packs, 12 packs, cases, 20 pack bottles, and 30 packs of beer and ale. Some imported beers are sold by fours. In addition, we get seasonal brews such as Octoberfests into our coolers as soon as they become available.

                                        There is still a big thirst for craft beer in Connecticut, too. We love pleasing our customers who stop in to get the latest releases from regional craft beer companies. There are even great tasting beers and ales from breweries all over Connecticut. If you don't see it, ask us. If our distributor carries it, we can get it for you.

                                        Every beer drinker loves a bargain and Sullivan's Liquors has one or more brands of beer on sale every month, usually on 12 packs or larger. It's the perfect way to keep within budget when throwing a party for a major sports event or someone's special day.

                                        Champagne has always been associated with wedding receptions and New Years. Many people also enjoy it in mixed drinks such as mimosas. Some people like to make gourment condiments such as champagne mustard, too.

                                        A bottle of champagne is the perfect gift for a business client, newlyweds, and someone who has won an award. An asti can be paired with a box of quality chocolates. A pint of strawberries goes well with pink champagne.

                                        Cordials are typically sweet alcoholic beverages that usually have a higher alcohol content than wine and beer. Almost all of them have a liquor base that is flavored with fruit, chocolate, coffee, spices or mint.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Some people drink cordials on the rocks. Others add cordials to mixed drinks for flavor and color. One or more cordials are used to make the fancy martinis that are so popular today. They also go into favorite drinks such as white Russians, toasted almonds, and margaritas.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Cordials are a must for a well stocked private bar. Our shelves are filled with the brand names of cordials people have trusted for years. We also save room for the novelty items and new flavors that come out every few months.

                                        Many recipes for popular cocktails that contain cordials are available online. We occasionally get recipe booklets for our customers from the manufacturers, too. You'll be the perfect host or hostess in no time.
